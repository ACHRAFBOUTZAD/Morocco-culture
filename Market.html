                <p>Clothing is a major characteristic of any culture. It is today considered a dominant figure that helps attract foreigners’ attention and interest to the culture attached, as globalization has helped cultures from different parts of the world to come together. Some people view clothes as just mere tools of covering the body and protecting it from external elements. However, throughout history, it has been proven that clothing transcends this external function and goes deeper to the level of determining the character of the person putting it on. This way, it allows one to tell others who he is, where he comes from, and which culture he belongs to. Different cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of multiple raw materials, and with time these clothes have become a major part of them and became the way that they show their own unique life style. In this article, you will learn about the specifics of Moroccan traditional clothing: how it came to be and what it looks like today.</p>
